# Description
Adaptation of the [DataCamp](https://www.datacamp.com) [Analyzing Motorcycle Part Sales](https://app.datacamp.com/learn/projects/1574) project using [DuckDB](https://duckdb.org/). 

In the related Jupyter Notebook the original project description is provided along with setting up the DuckDB environment and tables. 

## Project Description
Motorcycles—cool! SQL skills—definitely cool! This project allows you to combine both—very cool!

Working on behalf of a company that sells motorcycle parts, you'll dig into their data to help them understand their revenue streams. You'll build up a query to find out how much net revenue they are generating across their product lines, segregating by date and warehouse.
